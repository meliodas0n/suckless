# THIS IS MY SUCKLESS

# I am not sure if it would suckless for you or not

# The way to install this suckless is to clone the repo to ~/.config (I hope you know how to clone)
# Now from the clone repo go to each folder mentioned below : 

# 1. st
# 2. dmenu
 

# and run "sudo make clean install" (without the quotes, please don't be dumb)
 
# TO THE MAIN THING : DWM
# Go inside the folder and delete the config.h file ('rm config.h' (you can use this without quotes btw, i will not hold responsible for your stupidity))
# Now run "sudo make clean install" and it should install without any issues
#
# PLEASE only experts can take a look dwmblocks- (I'm not but I have it for no reason, as such I am not clear with what to do)
# FYI - the scripts for dwmblocks is inside the 'scripts' folder - but yeah it's at your OWN RISK

# If you understand the stuff that's happening inside this repo and are kind enough to write really nice README.md by all means
# I would APPRECIATE it VERY MUCH!!,
# THANKS IN ADVANCE
